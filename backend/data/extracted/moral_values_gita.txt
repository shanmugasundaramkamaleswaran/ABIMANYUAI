# Moral Values from The Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita, extracted from the PDF, teaches profound moral and philosophical lessons through the dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna. Below is a summary of the key moral values derived from its teachings:

## 1. Duty and Righteous Action (Karma Yoga)
- Perform your prescribed duties without attachment to the results.
- Focus on action, not outcomes. (Chapter 2, Verse 47: "You have the right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions.")

## 2. Detachment and Equanimity
- Accept pleasure and pain, success and failure with equanimity.
- The soul is eternal; the body is temporary. (Chapter 2, Verse 14: "The nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress... one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.")

## 3. Self-Control and Discipline
- Control the mind and senses to achieve inner peace.
- Avoid excessive desires and ego. (Chapter 6: Dhyana Yoga emphasizes meditation and self-mastery.)

## 4. Devotion and Surrender (Bhakti Yoga)
- Devote yourself to God with love and faith.
- Surrender to the divine will for liberation. (Chapter 12: The Path of Devotion.)

## 5. Knowledge and Self-Realization (Jnana Yoga)
- Seek knowledge of the true self and the ultimate reality.
- Understand the difference between the body, mind, and soul. (Chapter 13: The Field and the Knower of the Field.)

## 6. Renunciation and Non-Attachment
- Renounce the fruits of actions, not the actions themselves.
- Live a life of detachment from material possessions. (Chapter 18: Liberation and Renunciation.)

## 7. Equality and Compassion
- See the divine in all beings; treat everyone equally.
- Show compassion and avoid hatred. (Chapter 6, Verse 32: "He who sees the same in all beings... is the best yogi.")

## 8. Righteousness and Dharma
- Uphold dharma (righteousness) in all actions.
- Fight for justice when necessary, even if it involves conflict. (Arjuna's duty to fight the just war.)

## 9. Non-Violence and Peace
- Practice ahimsa (non-violence) in thought, word, and deed.
- Strive for inner and outer peace. (Chapter 16 contrasts divine and demoniac qualities.)

## 10. Humility and Service
- Be humble and serve others selflessly.
- Avoid pride and arrogance. (Chapter 18 emphasizes true renunciation.)

These values guide individuals towards spiritual growth, ethical living, and ultimate liberation (Moksha). The Gita emphasizes that true happiness comes from within, through alignment with one's dharma and connection to the divine.
